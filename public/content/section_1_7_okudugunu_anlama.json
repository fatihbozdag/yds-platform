          "passage": "The concept of artificial intelligence has evolved dramatically over the past decades. Early AI systems relied on rule-based programming, where computers followed explicit instructions to solve specific problems. However, modern machine learning approaches enable computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. This shift has led to remarkable advances in fields like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. Despite these achievements, current AI systems still lack general intelligence—the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across diverse domains as humans do. The path to achieving artificial general intelligence remains uncertain, with researchers debating whether incremental improvements or fundamentally new approaches will be necessary.",

These tiny plastic fragments, less than five millimeters in size, originate from the breakdown of larger plastic items and the release of microbeads from personal care products. Marine ecosystems are particularly affected, as microplastics are consumed by organisms ranging from plankton to whales, entering food chains and potentially reaching human consumers. Research indicates that microplastics can carry toxic chemicals and may disrupt endocrine systems in marine life. The long-term health implications for humans remain unclear, though preliminary studies suggest cause for concern.

When patients believe they are receiving treatment, even inactive substances can produce measurable physiological improvements. Brain imaging studies reveal that placebos activate neural pathways associated with pain relief and reward, triggering the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters. This phenomenon challenges the simplistic separation of mind and body in medical treatment. While placebos cannot cure serious diseases, they can alleviate symptoms and enhance the effectiveness of actual medications, particularly for conditions involving pain, anxiety, and depression.",

Chronic insufficient sleep impairs cognitive function, including memory consolidation, decision-making, and emotional regulation. Physically, sleep loss weakens immune response, increases inflammation, and elevates risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. The relationship is bidirectional—poor health also disrupts sleep, creating a vicious cycle.

Bacteria evolve resistance through natural selection when antibiotics kill susceptible strains, leaving resistant ones to multiply. Overprescription of antibiotics in medicine and their widespread use in agriculture accelerate this process. As resistance spreads, common infections become difficult or impossible to treat, leading to higher mortality rates and healthcare costs. Addressing this requires a multipronged approach: physicians must prescribe antibiotics judiciously, only for bacterial infections. Agricultural practices should eliminate routine antibiotic use in livestock. Public health campaigns can educate people about the dangers of antibiotic misuse. Simultaneously, pharmaceutical companies need incentives to develop new antibiotics. Without coordinated action, we risk returning to a pre-antibiotic era where minor infections prove fatal.",

Farming allowed food surpluses, which supported population growth and enabled specialization—not everyone needed to produce food. This specialization led to the development of crafts, trade, and eventually complex social hierarchies. Permanent settlements required governance structures, giving rise to political institutions and legal systems. Food surpluses also allowed the emergence of a leisured class with time for art, philosophy, and science, accelerating cultural development.

Sleep loss also affects the prefrontal cortex, which governs decision-making and emotional regulation, leading to poor judgment and irritability.

Okuma Stratejileri:**\n\n*A. Soruları Önce Okuma (Questions-First Strategy):*\n\nAvantajlar:\n- Ne aranacağını bilirsiniz (targeted reading)\n- Irrelevant detayları atlayabilirsiniz\n- Anahtar kelimeleri locate etmek kolay\n\nNe zaman kullanılır:\n- Detail questions çoğunluktaysa\n- Zaman sıkışıksa\n\nNasıl:\n1. Tüm soruları hızla okuyun (cevapları değil, sadece soruları)\n2. Anahtar kelimeleri not edin (mental olarak veya underline)\n3. Pasajı okurken bu kelimeleri arayın\n\n*B. Pasajı Önce Okuma (Passage-First Strategy):*\n\nAvantajlar:\n- Ana fikir ve yapı daha iyi anlaşılır\n- Inference ve tone soruları için daha iyi\n- Bağlamı tam anlarsınız\n\nNe zaman kullanılır:\n- Main idea, inference, tone soruları çoğunluktaysa\n- Pasaj kısa ve basitse\n\nNasıl:\n1. Pasajı aktif olarak okuyun (main idea, structure, tone)\n2. Her paragrafın topic sentence'ını not edin\n3. Sorulara geçin, gerekliyse pasaja dönün\n\n*C. Hibrit Strateji (Hybrid - ÖNERİLEN):*\n\n1. **Soruları hızla tarayın** (10-15 saniye): Ne tür sorular var? (main idea, detail, inference?)\n2. **İlk paragrafı dikkatle okuyun**: Topic/thesis genellikle buradadır\n3. **Geri kalan pasajı skim yapın**: Topic sentences, key points\n4. **Soruları sırayla çözün**, gerekliyse pasaja dönün\n\n**3. Soru Önceliklendirme:**\n\n*Kolay → Zor sırası (önce puanı garanti edin):*\n\n1. **Detail/Factual Questions (En kolay):**\n   - \"According to the passage...\"\n   - Direct information, metinde açıkça yazılı\n   - Zaman: 1-1.5 dakika\n\n2. **Vocabulary in Context:**\n   - \"The word X in line Y means...\"\n   - Bağlamdan tahmin edilebilir\n   - Zaman: 1 dakika\n\n3. **Main Idea Questions:**\n   - Pasaj anlaşıldıysa kolay\n   - Zaman: 1.5-2 dakika\n\n4. **Inference Questions (Zor):**\n   - Mantıksal çıkarım gerektirir\n   - Daha fazla düşünme\n   - Zaman: 2-2.5 dakika\n\n5. **Author's Purpose/Tone (Orta-Zor):**\n   - Tüm pasajın anlaşılması gerekir\n   - Zaman: 1.5-2 dakika\n\n*Strateji:*\n- Her pasajda önce \"According to\" sorularını çözün (quick points)\n- Sonra main idea, sonra inference\n- Çok zor soruyu atlayın, sona bırakın (time management)\n\n**4. Zaman Tasarrufu Teknikleri:**\n\n*Skimming (Göz Gezdirme):*\n- İlk cümle + son cümle her paragrafın (main ideas)\n- Key words: however, therefore, importantly\n- Sayılar, tarihler, proper nouns (easy to locate later)\n\n*Scanning (Tarama):*\n- Spesifik bilgi ararken (detail questions)\n- Soru kelimesini metinde bulun\n- Etrafındaki 1-2 cümleyi okuyun\n\n*Elimeleme:*\n- Açıkça yanlış seçenekleri hemen eleyip\n- 2-3 seçenek kaldığında dikkatlice okuyun\n- Metinle doğrulayın\n\n**5. Yaygın Zaman Hataları:**\n\n❌ **Tüm pasajı kelime kelime okumak** → Skim yapın, sonra detail\n❌ **Bir soruya takılıp kalmak** → 2 dakikadan fazla harcanmaz, işaretleyip geç\n❌ **Soruları rastgele çözmek** → Sıralı veya kolay→zor\n❌ **Cevapları metinle doğrulamamak** → Hızlı scan yapın\n❌ **Seçenekleri çok dikkatli okumak** → Önce eliminate, sonra detail\n\n**6. Sınav Günü Zaman Yönetimi:**\n\n*İlk 30 dakika:*\n- Vocabulary/Grammar (hızlı puanlar)\n\n*30-90 dakika:*\n- Cloze/Paragraph Completion\n- Dialogue\n\n*90-150 dakika:*\n- Reading Comprehension (4-5 pasaj)\n- Pasaj başına ~12-15 dakika strict\n\n*150-170 dakika:*\n- Translation (dikkatlice)\n\n*Son 10 dakika:*\n- İşaretli soruları gözden geçir\n- Boş bırakma, tahmin et\n\n**ALTIN KURAL: Bir pasajda 15 dakikadan fazla kalmayın. İşaretleyip geçin, sonra dönün.**",
