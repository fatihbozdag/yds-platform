      "content": "YDS ve YÖKDİL okuma sorularında en temel beceri, paragrafın ana fikrini (main idea) destekleyici detaylardan (supporting details) ayırt edebilmektir. Ana fikir, yazarın o paragrafta iletmek istediği merkezi düşüncedir ve genellikle paragrafın ilk veya son cümlesinde (topic sentence) bulunur. Ancak bazen ana fikir paragraf boyunca ima edilir ve hiçbir cümlede açıkça belirtilmez (implied main idea).\n\nAna fikir geneldir, kapsayıcıdır ve paragraftaki tüm bilgileri birleştirir. Destek cümleleri ise spesifiktir: örnekler, istatistikler, alıntılar, açıklamalar, karşılaştırmalar veya nedenler sunar. Ana fikir soruları şu kalıplarla gelir: 'What is the main idea?', 'The passage is mainly about...', 'The primary purpose of the passage is to...', 'The author's main concern is...', 'Which of the following best summarizes the passage?'\n\nYanlış seçenekler genellikle şu kategorilere ayrılır: (1) Too narrow: Sadece bir detaya odaklanan seçenek, (2) Too broad: Paragraftan daha geniş bir konuyu kapsayan seçenek, (3) Not mentioned: Metinde hiç bahsedilmeyen bilgi, (4) Contradictory: Metinle çelişen ifade, (5) Peripheral detail: Yan bir detay ana fikir gibi sunulan seçenek.\n\nStrateji: Önce paragrafı hızlıca okuyun ve kendinize 'Bu paragraf ne hakkında?' sorusunu sorun. Sonra her cümlenin rolünü belirleyin: Bu cümle ana fikri mi sunuyor, yoksa onu mu destekliyor? Ana fikir seçeneği tüm paragrafa uymalı, çok dar veya çok geniş olmamalıdır. Seçenekleri okurken 'Bu tüm paragrafı kapsar mı?' testini uygulayın.",

          "question": "[Passage] Despite widespread belief that multitasking enhances productivity, cognitive research consistently demonstrates the opposite. Studies using fMRI scans reveal that the brain cannot genuinely focus on multiple complex tasks simultaneously; instead, it rapidly switches attention between tasks, incurring a 'switching cost' each time. This cost manifests as increased error rates, longer completion times, and elevated stress hormones. In educational settings, students who multitask during lectures retain 20-40% less information than focused peers. Workplace research mirrors these findings: employees who limit interruptions complete projects 50% faster with higher quality outputs.\n\nWhat is the main idea of this passage?",

          "question": "[Passage] The concept of 'food deserts' – urban areas where residents lack access to affordable, nutritious food – has gained prominence in public health discourse. Low-income neighborhoods often contain numerous fast-food outlets and convenience stores but few supermarkets offering fresh produce. A Chicago study found that residents in food deserts travel an average of 2.8 miles to reach a grocery store, compared to 0.9 miles in other areas. This geographic barrier correlates with higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in affected communities. Moreover, limited access to healthy food perpetuates a cycle: poor nutrition undermines economic productivity, making it harder for communities to attract supermarket chains that require specific income thresholds.\n\nWhich of the following best summarizes the passage?",

Groundbreaking research on London taxi drivers revealed that their hippocampi—brain regions associated with spatial memory—were significantly larger than those of control subjects, and this enlargement correlated with years of navigation experience. Stroke rehabilitation studies further demonstrate neuroplasticity: intensive therapy can help patients regain lost functions as undamaged brain areas assume roles previously performed by injured regions.

          "question": "[Passage] The Industrial Revolution fundamentally transformed not only economic systems but also social structures, family dynamics, and even concepts of time. Pre-industrial societies organized daily life around natural cycles—sunrise, sunset, seasonal rhythms. Factory production, however, required synchronized labor, giving rise to mechanical timekeeping and the rigid division of days into work hours and leisure time. This shift had profound psychological effects: workers experienced a new form of alienation, separated from both the products of their labor and traditional community ties. Children, previously integrated into family production, were increasingly sent to schools designed to instill punctuality and obedience—traits valued by industrial employers. Thus, what we now consider 'natural' ways of organizing time and childhood are actually historical constructions shaped by economic imperatives.\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of this passage?",

They can solve puzzles, use tools (such as carrying coconut shells for shelter), and demonstrate episodic memory by remembering specific events. Most surprisingly, each of the octopus's eight arms contains a semi-autonomous nervous system—roughly two-thirds of its neurons are in the arms, not the brain—allowing each limb to perform tasks independently while the central brain coordinates overall strategy. This distributed cognition represents a fundamentally different neurological architecture from vertebrate intelligence, suggesting that complex problem-solving can evolve through radically different biological pathways.\n\nThe author's main point is that:",

          "question": "[Passage] Antibiotic resistance, once confined to hospitals, now permeates communities worldwide, threatening to render common infections deadly again. Overuse in human medicine accounts for part of the problem, but agricultural practices play an equally significant role: approximately 70% of antibiotics produced globally are used in livestock, often as growth promoters rather than disease treatments. These agricultural antibiotics enter soil and water systems, creating environments where resistant bacteria flourish. A recent Danish study found antibiotic-resistant genes in 95% of pig farms tested, with identical resistance patterns appearing in nearby human populations. Unless regulatory policies address both medical and agricultural antibiotic use, experts warn we may enter a 'post-antibiotic era' where routine surgeries become life-threatening.\n\nWhich of the following best expresses the main idea?",

Psychologist Angela Duckworth's research with West Point cadets, spelling bee champions, and salespeople showed that grit scores predicted achievement better than aptitude measures. However, critics argue this narrative oversimplifies success by ignoring systemic barriers. A student facing poverty, food insecurity, or discrimination may possess tremendous grit yet still struggle to achieve due to structural obstacles beyond individual control. Furthermore, the emphasis on grit can shift blame onto individuals for failures rooted in inequitable systems, effectively obscuring the need for social reforms.\n\nThe passage suggests that:",

Each loss represents not merely words but entire knowledge systems—indigenous ecological wisdom, unique conceptual frameworks, oral histories. For instance, the Yupik languages of Alaska contain dozens of words distinguishing snow and ice types, encoding survival knowledge accumulated over millennia. Documentation efforts by linguists provide some preservation, but recordings cannot capture the lived experience of thinking and creating within a language. Revitalization requires intergenerational transmission: children must use the language in daily life, not just study it academically.

Remarkably, the effect persists even when patients know they're receiving a placebo: a Harvard study gave irritable bowel syndrome patients clearly labeled 'placebo pills' and still observed significant symptom reduction compared to no-treatment controls. Neuroimaging shows placebos activate the same brain regions as actual medications, triggering release of endorphins and dopamine. Placebo responses vary by cultural context and medical ritual: pills work better than injections in Germany (where pills are trusted) but the reverse in Brazil (where injections are prestigious).

      "content": "Akademik metinler bilgiyi yapılandırmak için belirli retorik stratejiler kullanır. YDS/YÖKDİL sınavlarında paragrafların veya cümlelerin işlevini tanıma yeteneği test edilir: 'The author uses this sentence to...', 'The primary function of the second paragraph is to...', 'In lines 12-15, the author...'\n\n1. TANIM (Definition): Bir kavramı açıklar. İşaretçiler: 'X is defined as...', 'X refers to...', 'X means...', 'By X, we mean...', 'X can be understood as...', 'In other words...'. Örnek: 'Metacognition refers to awareness and regulation of one's own thought processes.' Tanımlar genellikle paragrafın başında gelir ve temel kavramı netleştirir.\n\n2. KARŞILAŞTIRMA/ZITLIK (Comparison/Contrast): Benzerlik veya farklılık gösterir. Benzerlik işaretçileri: 'similarly', 'likewise', 'in the same way', 'analogously', 'correspondingly'. Zıtlık işaretçileri: 'however', 'in contrast', 'whereas', 'unlike', 'conversely', 'on the other hand', 'nevertheless', 'albeit'. Örnek: 'While quantitative research emphasizes measurement, qualitative research focuses on meaning and interpretation.' Bu strateji iki yaklaşımı/teorisi/bulguyu netleştirmek için kullanılır.\n\n3. SINIFLANDIRMA (Classification): Bir bütünü kategorilere ayırır. İşaretçiler: 'can be divided into', 'falls into X categories', 'there are several types of', 'X is classified as...', 'consists of'. Örnek: 'Learning strategies can be divided into three categories: cognitive, metacognitive, and social/affective.' Sınıflandırma karmaşık kavramları organize etmeye yarar.\n\n4. NEDENLEME (Cause/Effect - Reasoning): Neden-sonuç ilişkisi kurar veya açıklama yapar. Neden işaretçileri: 'because', 'since', 'due to', 'owing to', 'as a result of', 'stems from'. Sonuç işaretçileri: 'therefore', 'thus', 'consequently', 'as a result', 'hence', 'accordingly', 'for this reason'. Örnek: 'Because the sample was not randomly selected, the findings cannot be generalized to the broader population.' Nedenleme bilimsel argümanın temelidir.\n\n5. ÖRNEKLEME (Exemplification): Genel fikri somutlaştırır. İşaretçiler: 'for example', 'for instance', 'such as', 'including', 'to illustrate', 'specifically', 'namely', 'a case in point'. Örnek: 'Many endangered languages lack written traditions. For instance, most Australian Aboriginal languages were exclusively oral until recently.' Örnekler soyut kavramları anlaşılır kılar.\n\n6. SÜREÇ (Process): Adımları sıralar. İşaretçiler: 'first', 'then', 'next', 'subsequently', 'finally', 'the process begins with', 'involves'. Örnek: 'Photosynthesis begins when chlorophyll absorbs light energy. This energy then splits water molecules...' YDS/YÖKDİL'de daha az görülür ama bilimsel metinlerde önemlidir.",
