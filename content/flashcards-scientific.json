  "studyTips": [
    "Focus on both literal scientific meanings and metaphorical uses (e.g., 'catalyst' in chemistry vs. 'catalyst for change')",
    "Pay attention to word families: 'hypothesis' → 'hypothesize' → 'hypothetical'",
    "Learn common collocations used in scientific writing (e.g., 'empirical evidence', 'rigorous testing')",
    "Distinguish between similar pairs: 'acute' vs. 'chronic', 'discrete' vs. 'discreet', 'inert' vs. 'innate'",
    "Note pronunciation differences when words function as both verb and noun (e.g., 'attribute')",
    "Many terms have specialized meanings in scientific contexts beyond their general use",
    "Practice recognizing these words in context from scientific articles and research papers",
    "Create associations between Turkish and English terms to aid retention",
    "Review medical terms ('acute', 'chronic', 'contagious', 'immune') as a separate subset",
    "Focus on environmental science terms increasingly common in YDS exams"
  ],
  "commonMistakes": [
    "Confusing 'empirical' (based on observation) with 'imperial' (relating to empire)",
    "Using 'hypothesis' when 'theory' is meant (hypothesis is unproven, theory is well-supported)",
    "Mixing up 'discrete' (separate) and 'discreet' (careful/subtle)",
    "Incorrect plural forms: 'stimulus' → 'stimuli', 'phenomenon' → 'phenomena', 'apparatus' → 'apparatuses'",
    "Misusing 'chronic' for short-term problems (it means long-term/persistent)",
    "Confusing 'precision' (exactness) with 'accuracy' (correctness)",
    "Using 'viable' only in biological sense, missing its broader 'feasible' meaning",
    "Forgetting that 'aggregate' can be verb, noun, or adjective with different pronunciations",
    "Misunderstanding 'adverse' as 'diverse' or 'averse'",
    "Using 'eradicate' when 'reduce' or 'minimize' is more appropriate (eradicate means complete elimination)"
